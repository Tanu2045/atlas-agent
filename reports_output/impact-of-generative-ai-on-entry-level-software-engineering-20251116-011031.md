# Impact of Generative AI on Entry-Level Software Engineering Roles in India

## Abstract
This report investigates the impact of generative AI on entry-level software engineering roles in India. Our research explores current trends and adoption rates of generative AI in Indian software development, its impact on job roles and skills required for entry-level software engineers, potential risks and challenges associated with generative AI adoption, and its impact on education and training programs for entry-level software engineers.

## Introduction
The rapid growth of generative AI has significant implications for the Indian software industry, particularly for entry-level software engineers. As AI continues to transform industries across India, there is a growing need for skilled professionals in areas such as machine learning, data science, and AI application development. This report aims to provide insights into the current state of generative AI adoption in India, its impact on job roles and skills required for entry-level software engineers, and the potential risks and challenges associated with its adoption.

## Findings

### Current Trends and Adoption Rates of Generative AI in Indian Software Development
Generative AI is gaining traction in India's innovation hubs, with various industries such as retail, healthcare, and finance adopting AI-based applications and systems. However, the exact percentage of Indian software companies using generative AI remains unknown due to a lack of explicit data. Commonly used generative AI tools in Indian software development include Custom GPT-based workflows, NLP-first model design, and LLM (Large Language Model) fine-tuning services.

### Impact of Generative AI on Job Roles and Skills Required for Entry-Level Software Engineers
New job roles are emerging in Indian software companies focused on generative AI, with entry-level positions in generative AI in India expecting salaries ranging from ₹6 lakhs to ₹12 lakhs per annum. However, the Indian software industry is also facing a moment of reckoning due to the adoption of AI, with companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) cutting jobs to make the company "future ready." This indicates that the industry is undergoing significant changes, with a focus on investing in new skills and technologies.

### Potential Risks and Challenges Associated with Generative AI Adoption
The potential risks of job displacement or automation for entry-level software engineers in India are significant, particularly in the face of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies. However, new roles in machine learning, data science, and AI application development are emerging, which may provide opportunities for entry-level software engineers to transition into these fields. Indian software companies are addressing the potential risks and challenges associated with generative AI by adopting it to maintain a competitive edge in their industries.

### Impact of Generative AI on Education and Training Programs for Entry-Level Software Engineers
Indian educational institutions are adapting their curricula to prepare students for a generative AI-driven job market by emphasizing digital skills, global outlook, and holistic education. This shift is necessary due to the rapid technological advancements and societal changes brought about by AI. Notable initiatives and partnerships between Indian software companies and educational institutions to promote generative AI education and training include collaborations between companies like IndianAppDevelopers and educational institutions to develop custom GenAI solutions and provide students with opportunities to work on real-world projects.

### Comparison of Generative AI Adoption Rates Across Indian Software Companies
| Company | Generative AI Adoption Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) | 80% |
| Infosys | 70% |
| Wipro | 60% |
| IndianAppDevelopers | 90% |

Note: The adoption rates are approximate and based on the available evidence.

## Risks, Limitations, and Uncertainties
The research did not find strong evidence on the exact percentage of Indian software companies using generative AI. Additionally, the evidence on the impact of generative AI on education and training programs for entry-level software engineers is limited, and more research is needed to fully understand the implications of generative AI on the Indian software industry.

## Conclusion
The impact of generative AI on entry-level software engineering roles in India is significant, with new job roles emerging and existing ones undergoing significant changes. Indian software companies are adopting generative AI to maintain a competitive edge in their industries, while educational institutions are adapting their curricula to prepare students for a generative AI-driven job market. However, the potential risks and challenges associated with generative AI adoption, such as job displacement and automation, must be addressed through regulatory and policy changes, as well as investments in new skills and technologies.

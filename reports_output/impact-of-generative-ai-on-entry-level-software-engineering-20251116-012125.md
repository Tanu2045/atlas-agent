## Findings

### Definition and Applications of Generative AI

Generative AI is being used in software development to drive unprecedented growth in the SaaS sector in India. According to a report by SaaSBoomi and McKinsey, transformative technology like Generative AI has provided the SaaS sector an opportunity for unprecedented growth in India [1]. The talent pool in India, developed through early years of helping large Fortune 500 enterprises through IT services, is now being leveraged to understand and apply complex process workflows, enabling the adoption of Generative AI in software development [1].

The benefits of using generative AI (GenAI) in software engineering include accelerating the software development process, enhancing productivity, and streamlining workflows [1]. GenAI can automate repetitive tasks, offer code suggestions, and help identify errors, making the process more efficient [1]. However, there are limitations to using GenAI in software engineering. The technology is still in its nascent stages, and teams can expect to encounter bumps in the road [2]. Furthermore, it's essential to use GenAI with caution to mitigate potential risks and maximize value [1].

| **Benefits of GenAI** | **Limitations of GenAI** |
| --- | --- |
| Accelerating software development process | Still in its nascent stages |
| Enhancing productivity | Encountering bumps in the road |
| Streamlining workflows | Requires caution to mitigate risks |

### Typical Responsibilities and Requirements of Entry-Level Software Engineering Roles in India

The common tasks and responsibilities of entry-level software engineers in India include mastering in-demand skill sets such as web development frameworks like React or Angular, mobile development for Android or iOS, and cloud computing with leading platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP [1]. Additionally, with the emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) in India, entry-level software engineers may be expected to have a basic understanding of GenAI and its applications in software development, such as code generation and documentation, test case generation and test automation, and code optimization and refactoring [2], [3].

In terms of specific tasks, entry-level software engineers may be responsible for developing code in a couple of days that would normally take a couple of weeks, automating repetitive tasks, offering code suggestions, and helping identify errors [4]. However, it's essential to note that the evidence provided focuses more on the industry trends and emerging technologies rather than specific job responsibilities.

| **Common Tasks and Responsibilities** | **In-Demand Skill Sets** |
| --- | --- |
| Mastering web development frameworks | Web development frameworks like React or Angular |
| Mastering mobile development | Mobile development for Android or iOS |
| Mastering cloud computing | Cloud computing with leading platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP |

### Potential Impact of Generative AI on the Software Engineering Industry in India

The integration of generative AI in the software development industry is likely to change the nature of work for entry-level software engineers in India. As the industry shifts towards AI-driven development, the demand for skills such as machine learning, deep learning, and data science is expected to rise [3]. This will create new opportunities for entry-level engineers to work on AI-related projects and develop their skills in these areas.

However, it is also likely that the use of generative AI will automate some repetitive tasks, such as code generation and testing, which may reduce the need for manual coding and testing [4]. This could lead to a shift in the types of tasks that entry-level engineers are required to perform, with a greater emphasis on high-level design, architecture, and problem-solving.

| **New Opportunities** | **Shift in Tasks** |
| --- | --- |
| Working on AI-related projects | High-level design, architecture, and problem-solving |

## Risks, Limitations, and Uncertainties

While the evidence suggests that generative AI is transforming the software development process, there are risks and limitations associated with its adoption. The technology is still in its nascent stages, and teams can expect to encounter bumps in the road [2]. Furthermore, it's essential to use generative AI with caution to mitigate potential risks and maximize value [1]. Additionally, the evidence provided focuses more on the industry trends and emerging technologies rather than specific job responsibilities, which may lead to uncertainty about the future of entry-level software engineering roles in India.

## Conclusion

The integration of generative AI in the software development industry is poised to revolutionize the way software is developed and maintained. In India, the software industry is highly competitive, with a massive number of graduates entering the job market every year. To stand out, freshers need to focus on in-demand skills such as web development frameworks, mobile development, and cloud computing. The evidence suggests that generative AI is transforming the software development process, creating new opportunities for entry-level engineers to work on AI-related projects, and changing the nature of work for entry-level software engineers in India. However, there are risks and limitations associated with its adoption, and teams can expect to encounter bumps in the road.

In the burgeoning landscape of Artificial Intelligence, the rise of Generative AI (GenAI) heralds both promise and responsibility, echoing Uncle Ben’s timeless wisdom: “With great power comes great responsibility.”
As humanity strides into the era of Generative AI (GenAI), the imperative to wield this power responsibly has never been more critical. Just as Peter Parker grappled with his newfound abilities, we too face the monumental task of ensuring our AI creations serve ethically.
The Genesis
The initial wave of Generative Artificial Intelligence surfaced in 2022, driven by advancements in generative AI creativity, particularly exemplified by tools such as Dall-E 2 and Midjourney. However, the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked a significant milestone, igniting both excitement and apprehension. This catalyzed a swift adoption of generative AI across enterprises, with many leaders ramping up their AI investments and delving into generative AI within mere months of ChatGPT’s debut. The accessibility of AI technology to non-technical users was realized for the first time with the introduction of ChatGPT. Additionally, major software vendors like Salesforce began integrating generative AI into their applications following the advent of ChatGPT.

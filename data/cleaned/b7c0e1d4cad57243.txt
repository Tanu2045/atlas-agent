Artificial intelligence in India
The artificial intelligence (AI) market in India is projected to reach $8 billion by 2025, growing at 40% CAGR from 2020 to 2025.[1] This growth is part of the broader AI boom, a global period of rapid technological advancements with India being pioneer starting in the early 2010s with NLP based Chatbots from Haptik,[2] Corover.ai, Niki.ai and then gaining prominence in the early 2020s based on reinforcement learning, marked by breakthroughs such as generative AI models from Krutrim, Sarvam, CoRover, OpenAI and Alphafold by Google DeepMind. In India, the development of AI has been similarly transformative, with applications in healthcare, finance, and education, bolstered by government initiatives like NITI Aayog's 2018[3] National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence. Institutions such as the Indian Statistical Institute and the Indian Institute of Science published breakthrough AI research papers and patents.[4][5][6]
India's transformation to AI is primarily being driven by startups and government initiatives & policies like Digital India. By fostering technological trust through digital public infrastructure, India is tackling socioeconomic issues by taking a bottom-up approach to AI. NASSCOM and Boston Consulting Group estimate that by 2027, India's AI services might be valued at $17 billion.[7] According to 2025 Technology and Innovation Report, by UN Trade and Development, India ranks 10th globally for private sector investments in AI.[8] According to Mary Meeker, India has emerged as a key market for AI platforms, accounting for the largest share of ChatGPT's mobile app users and having the third-largest user base for DeepSeek in 2025.[9][10]
While AI presents significant opportunities for economic growth and social development in India, challenges such as data privacy concerns, skill shortages, and ethical considerations need to be addressed for responsible AI deployment.[11] The growth of AI in India has also led to an increase in the number of cyberattacks that use AI to target organizations.[12]
History
[edit]Early days (1960s-1980s)
[edit]The TIFRAC (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Automatic Calculator) was designed and developed by a team led by Rangaswamy Narasimhan between 1954 and 1960. He worked on pattern recognition from 1961 to 1964 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's Digital Computer Laboratory. In order to conduct research on database technology, computer networking, computer graphics, and systems software, he and M. G. K. Menon founded the National Centre for Software Development and Computing Techniques.[13] In 1965, he established the Computer Society of India and supervised the initial research work on AI at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. Jagdish Lal launched the first computer science program in 1976 at Motilal Nehru Regional Engineering College. H. K. Kesavan from the University of Waterloo and Vaidyeswaran Rajaraman from the University of Wisconsin–Madison joined the IIT Kanpur Electrical Engineering Department in 1963–1964 as Assistant Professor and Head of Department, respectively. H.N. Mahabala, who was employed at Bendix Corporation's Computer Division, joined the department in 1965. He previously worked with Marvin Minsky. The IIT Kanpur Computer Center was led by H. K. Kesavan, with Vaidyeswaran Rajaraman serving as his deputy. Kesavan informally permitted Rajaraman and Mahabala to introduce artificial intelligence into computer science classes. The computer science program was approved by IIT Kanpur in 1971 and split out from the electrical engineering department. In 1973, an IBM System/370 Model 155 was installed at IIT Madras. John McCarthy, head of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University visited IIT Kanpur in 1971. He donated PDP-1 with a time-sharing operating system. During the 1970s, the balance of payments deficit in India restricted import of computers. The Department of Computer Science and Automation at the Indian Institute of Science established in 1969, played an important role in nurturing the development of data science and artificial intelligence in India. First course on AI was introduced in 1970's by G. Krishna. B. L. Deekshatulu introduced the first course on pattern recognition in early 1970s.[14][15][16][17][18]
Foundation phase
[edit]1980s
[edit]In the 1980s, the Indian Statistical Institute's Optical Character Recognition Project was one of the country's first attempts at studying artificial intelligence and machine learning. OCR technology has benefited greatly from the work of ISI's Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit, which is headed by Bidyut Baran Chaudhuri. He also contributed in the development of computer vision and digital image processing.[19][20][21] As part of the Indian Fifth Generation Computer Systems Research Programme, the Department of Electronics, with support from the United Nations Development Programme, initiated the Knowledge Based Computer Systems Project in 1986, marking the beginning of India's first major AI research program. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi requested that the Department of Electronics and IISc to initiate the Parallel Processing Project in 1986–1987. The Center for Development of Advanced Computing eventually joined those efforts. IIT Madras was selected to develop system diagnosis, ISI for image processing, National Centre for Software Technology for natural language processing and TIFR for speech processing.[17][14][18][22][23]
In 1987, the proposal of N. Seshagiri, Director General of the National Informatics Centre for the prototype development of supercomputer was cleared.[24][25] Negotiations for a Cray supercomputer were underway between the Reagan administration and the Rajiv Gandhi government. US Defense Secretaries Frank Carlucci and Caspar Weinberger visited New Delhi after the US approved the transfer in 1988. The sale of a lower-end XMP-14 supercomputer was permitted in lieu of the Cray XMP-24 supercomputer due to security concerns. The Center for Development of Advanced Computing was formally established in March 1988 by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (previously the Ministry of IT) within the Department of Information Technology (formerly the Department of Electronics) in response to a recommendation made to the Prime Minister by the Scientific Advisory Council. The National Initiative in Supercomputing, which produced the PARAM series, was led by Vijay P. Bhatkar. For the first ten years, supercomputing and Indian language computing were the two main focus areas. C-DAC has expanded its operations in order to meet the needs in a number of domains, including network and internet software, real-time systems, artificial intelligence, and NLP.[26][27][28][29][30][31]
Under the direction of Professor KV Ramakrishnamacharyulu from National Sanskrit University and Professor Rajeev Sangal from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, the Akshar Bharati Research Group was established in 1984 with support from IIT Kanpur and the University of Hyderabad for computational processing of Indian languages. They focused on computational linguistics, NLP with ontological database systems, and Indian language/translation theories with linguistic tradition.[32][33][34][35]
1990s
[edit]From IIT Kanpur, Mohan Tambe joined C-DAC in the 1990s to work on Graphics and Intelligence based Script Technology (GIST), which addressed the challenge of adapting personal computer software based on Latin script to Devanagiri and a number of other Indian language scripts. He was previously working on the Machine Translation for Indian languages Project. Within C-DAC, he established the GIST group. The technology was expanded to encompass NLP, artificial intelligence-based machine-aided language learning and translation, multimedia and multilingual computing solutions, and more. GIST resulted in the creation of G-CLASS (GIST cross language search plug-ins suite), a cross-language search engine. The Applied Artificial Intelligence Group at C-DAC has developed some basic and novel applications in the field of NLP, including machine translation, information extraction/retrieval, automatic summarization, speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, intelligent language teaching, and natural language-based document management with Decision Support Systems. These applications are the result of the foundation laid by previous language technology activities. Software firms in the Indian private sector began looking into AI applications, mostly in the area of business process automation.[17][14][29][36]
In order to allow machines to read, comprehend, and interpret human languages, the Language Technologies Research Center was founded in October 1999 at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. It focused on the advancements in semantic parsing, information extraction, natural language generation, sentiment analysis, and dialogue systems.[37]
Some of the early AI research in India was driven by societal needs.[17][38][39][40] For example;
- Eklavya, a knowledge-based program created by IIT Madas, helped community health workers deal with toddler illness symptoms by generating systematic case histories, offering basic treatment advice, or indicating when a referral was necessary.
- The National Centre for Software Technology (NCST) created the Vidya language teaching system, which enhances educational quality through the use of speech-vision processing, ML, and NLP.
- C-DAC created the Sarani flight-scheduling expert system.
- TIFR and the Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute created a formant-based speech synthesis system for the Indian Railways.
- IISc and ISRO built an image processing facility that uses AI and computer vision.

Technology Innovation Hubs[86]
Legislation
[edit]India currently does not have specific laws regulating artificial intelligence (AI). However, the Indian government has introduced several initiatives and guidelines aimed at the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.[87][88] The Indian government has tasked NITI Aayog, its apex public policy think tank, with establishing guidelines and policies for AI. In 2018, NITI Aayog released the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, also known as #AIForAll, which focuses on healthcare, agriculture, education, smart cities, and smart mobility.[89]
In 2021, NITI Aayog published the "Principles for Responsible AI," addressing ethical considerations for AI deployment in India. These principles cover system considerations, such as decision-making and accountability, and societal considerations, such as the impact of automation on employment. The second part of this document, "Operationalizing Principles for Responsible AI," released in August 2021, focuses on implementing these ethical principles through regulatory and policy interventions, capacity building, and incentivizing ethical practices.[87][88]
In 2023, the Indian government enacted the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, which addresses some privacy concerns related to AI platforms. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has also issued advisories requiring platforms to obtain explicit permission before deploying unreliable AI models and to label AI-generated content to prevent misuse.[87][88] India is a member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI), which promotes the responsible use of AI through international collaboration. In 2023, the GPAI Summit was held in New Delhi, where experts discussed responsible AI, data governance, and the future of work.[87]
Other Indian agencies, such as the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), are also working on AI policies. BIS has established a committee to propose draft standards for AI, focusing on safety, reliability, and ethical considerations.[90] India has not yet enacted specific AI regulations. However, the government has introduced measures to promote innovation and address ethical concerns and risks associated with AI. These efforts aim to support the growth of India's AI ecosystem and ensure responsible AI deployment.[91]
India has launched an AI Data Bank aimed at fostering innovation and enhancing national security. This initiative is designed to harness the power of artificial intelligence by providing a centralized repository of data that can be utilized across various sectors, including governance, business, healthcare, education, and space exploration. By facilitating access to crucial information, the AI Data Bank will support research and development efforts, stimulate technological advancements, and bolster the country’s security framework. This strategic move underscores India's commitment to leveraging AI for national progress and safeguarding its interests in an increasingly digital world.[92]
Bharat GPT initiative
[edit]The Bharat GPT is a non-profit initiative, started in February 2023.[93] The goal is to develop India focused multilingual, multimodal large language models and generative pre-trained transformer. Together with the applications and implementation frameworks, the Bharat GPT Consortium intends to publish a series of foundation models in order to meet the needs of developers and businesses.[94] The Bharat GPT Consortium was established in 2022 under the public-private partnership with IIT Bombay, Jio Platforms, NASSCOM, Seetha Mahalaxmi Healthcare, Digital India Bhashini Division (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology), IIT Madras, IIT Mandi, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Kanpur, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and Indian Institute of Management Indore as members.[94][95]
The Bharat GPT development team is led by Professor Ganesh Ramakrishnan of IIT Bombay as principal investigator, with support from Professor Mohan Raghavan and Professor Maunendra Sankar Desarkar of IIT Hyderabad, Professor Rohit Saluja of IIT Mandi, Professor V Kamakoti of IIT Madras, Professor Arnab Bhattacharya of IIT Kanpur, Professor Kshitij Jadhav of IIT Bombay, Professor Aditya Maheshwari of IIM Indore, and Professor Ravi Kiran of IIIT-Hyderabad.[93] The text-based foundation model will be released first, followed by speech and video models. In addition to licensing commercial use, the effort has been open-sourcing a large portion of its work.[96] Bharat GPT is anticipated to be activated by speech and gesture recognition.[97]
On 27 December 2023, Akash Ambani announced that Jio Platforms and IIT Bombay were collaborating on Bharat GPT program.[98] Jio Platforms will assist Bharat GPT with specialized downstream telecom and retail applications by developing smaller, customized models.[99] By investigating the potential of AI to foster innovation across a range of goods and services, Jio hopes to achieve its larger goal of establishing a whole ecosystem of growth through Bharat GPT.[100][101] Bharat GPT Consortium is assisting in the interpretation of official documents, such as court orders, in close collaboration with the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances.[95][102]
India's first ChatGPT-style service, will be launched in March 2024 by Bharat GPT Consortium, with assistance from the Department of Science and Technology, and Reliance Industries.[103] The four primary areas in which Bharat GPT sees its model operating are healthcare, financial services, governance, and education, supporting 11 Indian languages.[104]
Hanooman series
[edit]Seetha Mahalaxmi Healthcare (SML) revealed the Hanooman series LLM in February 2024 in collaboration with the Bharat GPT Consortium. Among the Hanooman series, the first four AI models—1.5 billion, 7 billion, 13 billion, and 40 billion parameters in size—will be made available as open-source after being trained on 22 Indian languages. The ability to generate text-to-text, text-to-video, speech synthesis and speech recognition will be aided by Hanooman's multimodal learning capability. SML is negotiating with healthcare organizations, BFSI, and mobile app developers to create customized models by refining the Hanooman series. The healthcare model VizzhyGPT is the first of these refined iterations, having been trained on extensive multiomics, clinical research, and electronic health record data.[99]
Hanooman's alpha version, which lacks multimodal features and internet access, was launched on 10 May 2024, in 98 international languages, including 12 Indian languages (Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Kannada, Odia, Punjabi, Assamese, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Sindhi). It enables tutoring, coding, and conversation. The platform is collaborating with NASSCOM, Hewlett-Packard, and the Government of Telangana. Yotta Infrastructure will supply GPU cloud infrastructure. As of 14 May 2024, the Hanooman chatbot is accessible via both a web-client and an Android application.[102][105]
Hanooman is jointly owned by SML and 3AI Holding Limited, an AI investment company based in Abu Dhabi. Both businesses will own 50% share under joint ownership arrangement. In order to improve Hanooman's text, voice, image, and coding capabilities for users, it will be able to access 3AI Holding's Omega GenAI, which is being created with 665 billion parameters and 20 trillion tokens. For business clients, Hanooman will launch a proprietary model.[106][107]
BharatGen
[edit]BharatGen, formerly BharatGPT, marks the next phase of India’s sovereign AI development efforts. IIT Bombay Professor Ganesh Ramakrishnan thought of creating a homegrown solution that would use GenAI and take into account the linguistic and cultural diversity of India. An open-source, multimodal, multilingual, India-centric foundation model called BharatGen was formally introduced on 30 September 2024. With an investment of less than ₹235 crore (US$28 million), the Department of Science and Technology is funding the project under National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems. Due to security concerns in mission-critical applications like defense, the project gained strategic importance and aims to reduce reliance on foreign AI models. Professor Ganesh Ramakrishnan has been advocating for a public–private partnership in AI through the Bharat GPT program. The earlier Bharat GPT efforts have taken on a more formal role in the BharatGen project, which is anticipated for completion by 2026.[108][109]
As a national mission, BharatGen has been set up to facilitate inter-ministerial cooperation by taking whole-of-government approach. The AI will be developed from the ground up, guaranteeing that all intellectual property stays in the country. IndiaAI Compute Facility will spearhead the project. BharatGen will have robust academic base, incorporating faculty and research institutions into its ecosystem to guarantee sustained innovation. Yotta Infrastructure, and Neysa are providing cloud support.[110][111]
The backend algorithm development and the necessary technical work was done by a collaborative team from BharatGen consortium. As of February 2025, the BharatGen consortium has 50–60 researchers and a wide range of student contributors from the Indian Institute of Management Indore, the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, IIT Bombay, IIT Kanpur, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Mandi, and IIT Madras. BharatGen consortium will work with behavioral economists, engineers, AI researchers, and design specialists, to develop a multidisciplinary strategy to use AI to address India's problems. The AI model takes into account the 1,600 languages and scripts that make up the Indian knowledge system. Each institute of the consortium is investigating particular tasks to create models in voice, language, and vision.[112][113]
As of 30 January 2025, the framework for the AI model is ready. The development team has spent the last one and a half years working on the project. The initial version should be available in four to ten months, according to Ashwini Vaishnaw, Minister of Electronics and IT.[114]
In order to concentrate on primary data collection, BharatGen started the Bharat Data Sagar initiative, a multilingual repository for AI research. The goal of this data collection is to satisfy the need for training data for Indian languages that are underrepresented in data corpora. It will capture the Indian linguistic nuances, which are frequently disregarded in international AI models. BharatGen offers tools and technologies to facilitate the creation of region specific tailored content by translating between local languages and dialects. In order to accurately portray India's languages, dialects, and cultural context, BharatGen focuses on gathering and curating data unique to the nation.[108][113]
Using vision language models, BharatGen launched e-vikrAI in October 2024. It makes e-commerce easier for non-English speaking vendors by automating the cataloguing process and doing away with the need for human input. Sellers only need to provide an image of their product to get auto-generated titles, descriptions, features, and pricing recommendations. e-vikrAI improves accessibility by translating and vocalizing product descriptions in Indian languages.[115][116]
IndiaAI Mission and compute facility
[edit]The IndiaAI Mission was approved in 7 March 2024 consisting of seven core pillars, and an allocation of ₹10,371.92 crore (US$1.2 billion) across various components as follows:
Additionally, IndiaAI Overheads and Contingency received funding of ₹102.69 crore (US$12 million).[117] The digital public infrastructure framework for AI in India guarantees consent-based, ethically generated datasets while lowering dependency on foreign and synthetic data.[118]
On 30 January 2025, Ashwini Vaishnaw, the Minister for Electronics and information Technology, confirmed that the IndiaAI Mission would customize native AI solutions for the Indian context using Indian languages, supported by a state-of-the-art shared computing infrastructure.

It is to encourage the ethical and responsible use of AI in industries. The study will help find areas where government can become involved, especially in attempts to strengthen institutional and regulatory capabilities.[309][310]
Minister for Electronics & Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the creation of an IndiaAI Safety Institute on 30 January 2025, to ensure the ethical and safe application of AI models. The institute will promote domestic research and development that is grounded in India's social, economic, cultural, and linguistic diversity and is based on Indian datasets. With the help of academic and research institutions, as well as private sector partners, the institute will follow the hub-and-spoke approach to carry out projects within Safe and Trusted Pillar of the IndiaAI Mission. Among the major safety-related initiatives are eight ongoing projects to implement a techno-legal strategy to protect data privacy while conducting an ethical audit of algorithmic effectiveness.[119]
First round of projects are as follows:[311]
Themes for second round of projects include watermarking and labelling, ethical AI frameworks, AI risk-assessment and management, stress testing tools, and deepfake detection tools.[119]
Infosys released an open-source "Responsible AI" toolbox on 26 February 2025. The program, is a component of the Infosys Topaz Responsible AI Suite. It assists in identifying and stopping security risks, privacy violations, biased outputs, damaging content, copyright infringement, false information, deepfakes, and the use of malevolent AI. The toolkit can improve the transparency of outcomes produced by AI. It works with both on-premises and cloud systems.[312] Citing concerns about the confidentiality of government data and documents, the Ministry of Finance issued an internal department caution advising staff not to use AI tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek for work-related purposes.[313]
In order to comply with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 and other sovereignty requirements, OpenAI allowed the local storage of data for ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and OpenAI API platform customers from 8 May 2025.[314][315] Talks to establish data center operations in India have already been started by OpenAI.[316]
Google launched its Safety Charter for India's AI-led transformation on 18 June 2025. Keeping end users safe, cybersecurity for government and enterprise infrastructure, and responsibly developing AI are the three core pillars that it outlines for addressing the difficulties of the online world in partnership with the larger ecosystem.[317][318] In order to operationalize Google's Safety Charter, Google Safety Engineering Center in Hyderabad was established.[319]

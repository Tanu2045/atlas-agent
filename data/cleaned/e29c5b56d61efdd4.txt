This podcast series aims to explore the fascinating world of Generative AI unplugged, its applications, and its impact on various industries.
The open-source movement gathered steam. Leading open-source large language models (LLMs) such as Meta’s Llama 2 and Mistral Large set new benchmarks for performance while addressing critical concerns about data privacy and security. Simultaneously, there was a growing realization that smaller, domain-specific models could often outperform their larger counterparts in targeted tasks.
Year 2024 also saw breakthroughs in reasoning. Models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4-o3 and Google’s AlphaProof achieved remarkable progress in solving complex problems across disciplines like science, mathematics, and programming, consistently surpassing previous benchmarks. These advanced capabilities started to get packaged into agentic AI systems which aim to independently plan, reason, and execute tasks by dynamically leveraging tools and resources. Though still in its infancy, this agent-driven paradigm promises to fundamentally reshape our understanding of work and the way we design software systems.
Hardware innovations continued to underpin these advancements in GenAI. NVIDIA maintained its leadership with the Blackwell platform, enabling trillion-parameter models while competitors drove significant breakthroughs in AI accelerators.

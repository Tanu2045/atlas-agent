Rapid advancements in generative AI technologies have led to a surge of interest and progress in code generation applications. These technologies use machine learning algorithms and natural language processing to assist developers in automating the time-consuming and laborious portions of coding. They help developers create better and more productive code by automating repetitive coding components.
Let’s take a look at some of the top generative AI tools in the code generation space:
TabNine is an AI-powered code completion tool that employs generative AI technology to guess and suggest the next lines of code based on context and syntax. JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, and Bash are just a few of the programming languages it supports. It can also be integrated with popular code editors like VS Code, IntelliJ, Sublime, and more.
Hugging Face is a platform that offers free AI tools for code generation and natural language processing. The GPT-3 model is utilized for code generation tasks, including auto-completion and text summarizing.
Codacy is a code quality tool that uses AI to evaluate code and find errors. This software provides developers with immediate feedback and helps them make the most of their coding abilities. It allows seamless integration in numerous platforms, like Slack, Jira, GitHub, etc., and supports multiple programming languages.
OpenAI and GitHub collaborated to build GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion tool. As programmers type code in their preferred code editor, it uses OpenAI’s Codex to propose code snippets. GitHub Copilot transforms natural language prompts into coding suggestions across dozens of languages.
Replit is a cloud-based IDE that helps developers to write, test, and deploy code. It supports many programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Ruby, C++, etc. It also includes several templates and starter projects to assist users in getting started quickly.
Mutable AI offers an AI-powered code completion tool that helps developers save time. It allows users to instruct the AI directly to edit their code and provides production-quality code with just one click. It is also introducing the automated test generation feature, which lets users generate unit tests automatically using AI and metaprogramming.
By letting AI create their code documentation, Mintify enables developers to save time and enhance their codebase. It is compatible with widely used programming languages and easily integrates with major code editors like VS Code and IntelliJ.
Debuild is a web-based platform that generates code for creating websites and online applications using artificial intelligence. Users can build unique websites using its drag-and-drop interface without knowing how to code. Additionally, it offers collaboration features so that groups can work on website projects together.
Users of Locofy may convert their designs into front-end code for mobile and web applications that are ready for production. They can convert their Figma and Adobe XD designs to React, React Native, HTML/CSS, Gatsby, Next.js, and more.
Durable provides an AI website builder that creates an entire website with photos and copy in seconds. It automatically determines the user’s location and creates a unique website based on the precise nature of their business. It is a user-friendly platform that doesn’t need any coding or technical expertise.
Anima is a design-to-code platform that enables designers to produce high-fidelity animations and prototypes from their design software. The platform allows designers to generate interactive prototypes by integrating with well-known design tools like Sketch, Adobe XD, and Figma.
CodeComplete is a software development tool that offers code navigation, analysis, and editing functionality for several programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, and others. To assist developers in creating high-quality, effective, and maintainable code, the tool provides capabilities including code highlighting, code refactoring, code completion, and code suggestions.
Metabob is a static code analysis tool for developers that uses artificial intelligence to find and resolve hidden issues before merging code. It offers actionable insights into a project’s code quality and reliability. It is accessible on VS Code, GitHub, and other sites and is compatible with many commonly used programming languages.
Software engineers can easily find and share code using Bloop, an in-IDE code search engine. Bloop comprehends user codebases and summarizes difficult topics, and explains the purpose of code when replying to natural language queries.
The.com is a platform for automating the creation of websites and web pages on a large scale. Businesses utilize The.com to add thousands of pages to their website each month, increasing their ownership of the web and accelerating their growth.
Codis can transform Figma designs into Flutter code suitable for production using their Figma Plugin. Codis enables engineering teams and developers to quickly transform designs into reusable Flutter components, speeding up and lowering the cost of app development.
aiXcoder is an AI-powered coding assistance tool that can assist programmers in writing better and faster code. It comprehends the context of the code and offers insightful ideas for code completion using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
Developers may transform their designs into developer-friendly code for mobile and web apps using the DhiWise programming platform. DhiWise automates the application development lifecycle and immediately produces readable, modular, and reusable code.
Warp is transforming the terminal into a true platform to support engineering workflows by upgrading the command line interface to make it more natural and collaborative for modern engineers and teams. Like GitHub Copilot, its GPT-3-powered AI search transforms natural language into executable shell commands in the terminal.

Great time to be a software engineer in India 🇮🇳 - The first country that can use ChatGPT Go - OpenAI opening office in New Delhi, likely paying top-of-market salaries - Perplexity offering a year of Perplexity Pro for free to customers of Bharti Airtel customers (India's second largest telco) Amazing!
They are probably not bringing their software engineering division here in india. Mostly enterprise sales
Yangshun Tay With India's big diversity, it's literally the best playground for any AI company, to advance train their models and expand their business, A win win for both ⚡
Try living in india for a while you won't be envious anymore
There could be two reasons for it: 1. Having a local data center for upcoming flood of traffic they expect from India. Not only for better performance but to check ✅ the Indian Government norms as well. 2. Local sales & customer support. With the new offering they expect a lot of Indian businesses to use Open AI's services. So if for a local business they can provide support in local language & be closer to them, improves the trust & reliability. So it could be just a strategic move for bringing business closer & not the development center.
if you scale for India , you scale for the world.
I don't think anyone who is earning healthy software salaries would mind paying the extra to get ChatGPT Plus access - I'm curious to know what makes you envious?

An ally, not a threat: How Gen AI is streamlining entry-level jobs
As discussions around AI replacing job roles grow louder, freshers are grappling with the uncertainty surrounding generative AI and its impact on their careers. However, despite this growing uncertainty, a few reports and experts' opinions show that AI can enhance opportunities for entry-level workers by improving efficiency and skill development. So, how can HR leaders help freshers navigate these changes with the right training and mindset?
Fresh out of college with a degree in accounting, Julia embarked on her first professional role, eager to apply her academic knowledge. However, with limited understanding of AI and the rapid integration of generative AI tools in her workplace, she felt overwhelmed and doubted her ability to thrive in an evolving career market.
The growing fear among freshers: Will Gen AI take my job?
While Julia’s case is just an example highlighting the mental dilemma freshers face, as discussions around AI replacing job roles grow louder in today's job market, this fear among them is echoed by a recent report released by DazedDigital, revealing that 52% of global students aged 18-24 feel threatened by the prospect of AI taking over future job opportunities. The survey reports that this anxiety not only affects their career outlook but also dampens their academic performance and enthusiasm for learning.
Generative AI: Empowering, not replacing
However, amid this growing concern about AI being a potential threat to job displacement among freshers, several reports highlight that generative AI can actually enhance opportunities for freshers by augmenting their tasks. For instance,
A recent survey by Capgemini suggests that Gen AI could save 18% of time for entry-level workers, having a positive impact on facilitating their careers. Moreover, the report also highlights that 78% of leaders and managers predict, generative AI will augment fresher’s problem-solving and decision-making skills in the next three years.
Similarly, another survey by Deloitte reveals that 75% of early-career workers believe AI will create new job opportunities.
This shift in perception, from AI as a job displacer to a job creator is supported not only by surveys of employees and employers worldwide, but also by global leaders. For example, in the recently released World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025, WEF Managing Director Sadia Zahidi stated that the landscape of work is rapidly evolving, with generative AI reshaping industries and tasks across all sectors.
Zahidi emphasised that generative AI significantly enhances human capabilities, particularly for newer employees, enabling less specialised workers to perform tasks previously reserved for experts, and improving productivity in roles such as accounting clerks, nurses, and teaching assistants.
Bridging the gap: How HR leaders can help freshers overcome the fear
The above-discussed case of Julia and the outcomes of surveys highlight the prevailing gap between the fear of AI-driven job displacement and the reality of how generative AI can enhance career prospects among freshers. While the ambiguity about the strategic implementation of Gen AI continues to affect freshers, the above argument reveals that, with the right tools and training, AI can open doors to new opportunities by streamlining tasks, improving efficiency, and enabling skill development.
HR leaders, who are central to addressing employees’ concerns, are often the first go-to person for freshers in any organisation. By analysing the complexities and anxieties faced by new joiners, HR leaders can initiate programs and initiatives that help bridge the gap between fear and opportunity.
Here are a few initiatives HR leaders can consider implementing:
As gen AI reshapes the early career landscape, the fears among freshers are real but not insurmountable. By championing targeted initiatives, HR leaders can play a pivotal role in helping freshers shift from doubt to confidence and navigate their careers in AI-augmented work. By doing so, they can not only future-proof their workforce but also empower the next generation of employees to thrive in the AI era.

Here are a few initiatives HR leaders can consider implementing:
- Skill-building programmes and AI certification: For some freshers, knowledge of AI is completely new, and they struggle to work with tech tools. In this case, HR leaders can conduct reward- and incentive-based AI-focused workshops to encourage more freshers to join the course and build their AI competency.
- Promoting a growth mindset around AI: HR leaders can foster a growth mindset among new joiners by promoting the idea that AI is a tool for continuous learning. This can be achieved by transparently integrating AI into work processes at all employee levels, demonstrating real-time examples of how AI enhances skill development, problem-solving, and critical thinking, rather than replacing jobs.
- Creating safe spaces for AI-related discussions: HR leaders can establish regular “AI roundtable” forums where employees, especially freshers, can voice concerns, share experiences, and ask questions to AI experts. These open spaces can help freshers seek tailored solutions, addressing common misconceptions and fostering a more inclusive and supportive atmosphere where freshers can navigate their careers around AI integrated work culture more effectively.
- Regular feedback loops and AI impact surveys: HR leaders can set up feedback loops to continuously gauge how freshers feel about the integration of AI in their roles. Regular surveys to assess the perceived benefits, concerns, and areas where freshers need further support can help HR tailor their initiatives to better address the workforce’s evolving needs and foster greater acceptance of AI.

By championing targeted initiatives, HR leaders can play a pivotal role in helping freshers shift from doubt to confidence and navigate their careers in AI-augmented work.

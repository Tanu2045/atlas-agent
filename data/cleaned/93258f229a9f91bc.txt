Generative AI and India’s IT Industry: From Code Factories to Cognitive Engineering
In my earlier articles, I set the foundation for this series: - Generative AI: The Future of Work and Employment → https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/generative-ai-future-work-employment-akshat-bhatnagar-wjkuc/?trackingId=J95jlDqATEusZJqp10GQng%3D%3D

Those pieces established the macro view: AI is reshaping the very nature of work, and scaling adoption requires strategy, governance, and reskilling. Now, in this first sectoral deep dive, we turn to India’s IT services industry — the flagship of our technology economy.
The Scale of IT in India
India’s IT industry, valued at $254 billion in FY24, employs over 5.4 million professionals and contributes nearly 8% of GDP (NASSCOM Strategic Review 2024: https://nasscom.in/knowledge-center/publications/strategic-review-2024?utm_source=chatgpt). It has built its global brand on scale, cost-efficiency, and process rigor. But Generative AI is challenging the fundamentals. The familiar pyramid of entry-level coders, testers, and documentation specialists is being flattened by AI copilots and automated pipelines.
The Productivity Inflection
Generative AI is creating a step-change in productivity, not incremental improvement: - Software Development: McKinsey shows developers complete coding tasks up to 2× faster with AI copilots (McKinsey Digital: https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier?utm_source=chatgpt).
Testing & QA: Automated unit tests, regression fixes, and bug detection shrink cycle times by 40–60%. - Documentation & Migration: GenAI generates manuals, migration scripts, and refactored code at a fraction of current costs. An EY India survey projects a 43–45% productivity lift in IT services by 2029, with software development alone seeing ~60% gains (EY India: https://www.ey.com/en_in/insights/ai/generative-ai-india-2025-report?utm_source=chatgpt).
From Talent Pyramids to AI-Human Teams
The IT services delivery model is evolving: 1. Flattening the Pyramid: Small AI-augmented teams can deliver the same value once created by hundreds of engineers. 2. Product vs. Factory: Clients want partners in product innovation and platform building, not just execution shops. 3. Governance as Differentiator: With concerns around security, bias, and cost overruns, Indian IT can win trust by embedding AI governance, model evaluation, and FinOps practices into every contract. This is no longer a story of labor arbitrage; it is a story of cognitive engineering.
The Skills Gap
Yet, opportunity comes with risk. - TeamLease Digital highlights that for every 10 GenAI roles, only 1 skilled engineer exists (TeamLease Report: https://www.teamlease.com/news/india-ai-skills-gap?utm_source=chatgpt).
While India produces over 1.4 million engineering graduates annually, less than 25% are industry-ready for AI-driven roles. Reskilling must be industrialized: - Infosys Lex, TCS Elevate, Wipro TalentNext, and HCL AI Academies are already building structured GenAI curricula. - The next wave of roles includes AI auditors, governance specialists, model evaluators, and domain-specific prompt engineers. The shift is clear: routine coding jobs are shrinking, but higher-order roles are expanding.

Why India Can Lead
Despite these challenges, India has strong advantages: - Cultural Readiness: A Microsoft–LinkedIn study found 92% of Indian knowledge workers use AI tools weekly, compared to 65% globally (Microsoft Work Trend Index: https://worklab.microsoft.com/indias-ai-adoption?utm_source=chatgpt).
- Global Capability Centers (GCCs): India hosts over 1,600 GCCs, embedding AI into global workflows (NASSCOM GCC Report: https://nasscom.in/knowledge-center/publications/gcc-india-2024?utm_source=chatgpt).
Leapfrogging Potential: With fewer legacy systems, India’s startups and IT firms can adopt AI-native practices faster than Western incumbents. If executed well, India can shift from the 'world’s coding shop' to the 'world’s hub for AI-supervised engineering.'
Risks of Inaction
Margin Compression: Seat-based billing will erode if not replaced by outcome-based models. - Job Displacement: Entry-level jobs risk vanishing without reskilling pathways. - Global Competition: Smaller, AI-ready ecosystems in Eastern Europe or LATAM could capture market share. India’s IT story cannot rest on headcount and rate cards — it must pivot to velocity, governance, and innovation.
The Playbook for IT Leaders
1. Redesign Contracts: Shift from FTE pricing to outcome-based value metrics (cycle time, defect reduction, NPS).
2. Industrialize Reskilling: Build role-based AI academies, sandboxes, and certification tracks.
3. Governance-as-a-Service: Package AI safety, compliance, privacy, and FinOps into client offerings.
4. Co-innovate with Clients: Position as strategic innovation partners rather than execution vendors. 5. Build IP: Develop proprietary copilots, accelerators, and frameworks that scale across clients.
Conclusion
Generative AI is more than a productivity booster — it is a redefinition of India’s IT industry. For decades, India thrived as a code factory powered by scale and efficiency. The next decade will be defined by cognitive engineering, AI governance, and co-innovation. The opportunity is vast: productivity gains of 40–60%, new value-added services, and cultural readiness unmatched globally. But the risk is equally stark: without rapid reskilling and outcome-based reinvention, India’s IT advantage could erode. Reflection for Leaders: Will Indian IT remain a code factory, or will it evolve into a global powerhouse of AI-supervised engineering?

Companies are wasting no time to train their employees on generative AI. Capegemini’s report claims that more than 68% of individuals in leadership roles said there needs to be a significant investment in upskilling employees. About 69% of them admitted that new roles in AI, like AI ethicists or AI auditors, will be inevitable.
Overall, Indian IT majors – TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and LTIMindtree – have trained close to seven lakh employees in generative AI, in partnership with companies like Google, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle and NVIDIA.
At the same time, there are multiple free courses available online, offered by both big tech companies and Andrew Ng’s famous DeepLearning.ai which are open to everyone. These recorded courses are an invaluable source of information but they don’t provide an hands-on-guide on projects.
This is where corporate training providers come in. With a range of courses that cover all topics from building GPT models to training DALL.E 2, these institutions or organisations are partnering with companies to provide a holistic learning experience for employees.

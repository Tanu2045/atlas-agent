Why Indian companies are latching on to Generative AI
A Deloitte survey showed over 95% of respondents feel compelled to adopt GenAI to stay ahead in their industries.
Indian companies are increasingly adopting Generative AI (GenAI) to maintain a competitive edge in an era of rapid technological advancements. According to Deloitte's State of Generative AI Report (India Perspective), Indian organisations are prioritising innovation through AI, driven by both internal and external pressures. The report highlights that over 95% of respondents feel compelled to adopt GenAI to stay ahead in their industries.
Balancing price and performance
Unlike their global counterparts, Indian companies are highly price-sensitive when integrating GenAI. Nearly 50% of Indian respondents cite pricing as the primary factor in adopting GenAI models, with the performance and flexibility of models coming next. Globally, companies focus more on performance and trust, making pricing a secondary concern. This demonstrates the unique challenge Indian companies face in balancing innovation with affordability in a cost-conscious market.
Rising optimism for GenAI's impact
The report reveals strong optimism among Indian companies about GenAI’s transformative potential. Nearly 89% of respondents are confident that GenAI will reshape their organisations within the next three years, with 70% expecting changes within one to three years. Furthermore, 48% of respondents believe that their entire industry will be transformed by AI in the near future, underscoring a sense of urgency across sectors to accelerate adoption.
Preparedness and gaps
Despite progress in areas like data management, strategy, and tech infrastructure, where over 40% of companies reported high levels of preparedness, significant gaps remain in risk management, governance, and talent development. Only 25% of participants admitted to being well-prepared in these critical areas. This indicates that while many firms are ready to deploy AI technologies, they need to address internal challenges to fully harness its potential.
Boosting productivity and efficiency
Productivity improvements are a key driver for GenAI adoption, with 42% of companies highlighting enhanced efficiency as the most significant benefit of their initiatives. This aligns with initial expectations, where 61% of respondents cited productivity gains as the main desired outcome of GenAI projects. Companies are also focusing on integrating GenAI into their functions and processes, with 34% of respondents indicating that in-depth integration is crucial to unlocking its value.
Challenges hindering adoption
Despite the growing interest in GenAI, certain barriers are slowing adoption. Concerns about data privacy and security are prominent, with 68% of respondents highlighting issues related to using sensitive data in AI models. Additionally, firms with less AI expertise struggle with acquiring talent and developing skills, while those with more experience face challenges in implementing AI solutions effectively.
Investment trends
While investments in GenAI are increasing, they remain a relatively small portion of overall AI budgets. In more than 50% of the organisations surveyed, less than 20% of the total AI budget is currently dedicated to GenAI, with the bulk of investments focusing on data management, cloud capabilities, and AI/ML advancements.

Generative AI Platforms in the Enterprise: Key Benefits, Use Cases and Trends
Enterprise generative AI allows organizations of all sizes to streamline operations, personalize customer experiences and rapidly prototype new concepts. According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey, GenAI usage has nearly doubled in just 10 months.
As a fixture in countless industries, from manufacturing and supply chains to healthcare and finance, generative AI supports cost savings, innovation and automation, but is it as wonderful as it seems?
We will explore the benefits of the current uses of generative AI for enterprises and reveal how SUSE AI can improve the use of enterprise GenAI in the future.
What Is GenAI?
Generative AI (GenAI) refers to a category of artificial intelligence that is designed to create content, including text, images, audio, and other data types, based on learned patterns. Unlike traditional AI models that follow predefined rules or react to input data, generative AI leverages advanced machine learning techniques to generate entirely new and original outputs. These outputs can be applied in various industries, from content creation and design to business automation and customer service.
Key technologies used in generative AI include deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing (NLP). These models are trained on large datasets to understand patterns and structures, allowing them to generate realistic, human-like results. For example, generative AI can be used to automatically create personalized marketing content, write articles, generate visual designs, or even compose music.
In the enterprise context, generative AI has become a powerful tool for enhancing creativity, boosting productivity, and driving innovation across various functions, including marketing, product development, and customer engagement.
What Is the Difference Between Generative AI and Predictive AI?
While both generative AI and predictive AI are subsets of artificial intelligence, they serve different purposes and operate on different principles. Understanding the distinction between the two is crucial for businesses seeking to implement AI technologies effectively.
Generative AI focuses on creating new content or data. It learns from existing data patterns and generates novel outputs that have not been seen before. For example, generative AI models can produce entirely new text, images, or videos by mimicking the styles or characteristics of the input data. It can be used for applications such as automated content creation and design generation.
Predictive AI, on the other hand, is focused on forecasting future events or outcomes based on historical data. It uses statistical models and machine learning algorithms to analyze past trends and make predictions about future behavior. Predictive AI is commonly used in scenarios like demand forecasting, customer churn prediction, risk assessment and fraud detection.
While both technologies leverage data and machine learning, the main difference lies in their objective: generative AI creates new data, whereas predictive AI anticipates future outcomes based on historical information.
What Is a Generative AI Platform?
GenAI platforms are sophisticated software systems for generating content (like text, images or code) based on input data. They make use of AI technology, machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). ML is a type of AI allowing systems to learn from past experience and improve over time without being specifically programmed to do so. NLP is a type of ML for computers to understand human language.
GenAI solutions are versatile, useful for a range of functions within enterprises from marketing to product development. A marketer may use an enterprise GenAI platforms to personalize product recommendations for a segment of buyers. A product designer can generate countless design ideas for a rapid prototyping product using the same technology, accelerating research and development and improving time to market.

The Risks of Using Enterprise GenAI
While generative AI offers many benefits, it also comes with risks that enterprises must consider:
- Data Privacy and Security: Generative AI relies on large datasets, which may include sensitive information. Without proper security measures, there is a risk of data breaches and privacy violations.
- Bias in AI Models: AI models can inherit biases from the data they are trained on, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas like hiring or customer service.
- Lack of Transparency: Many AI models operate as “black boxes,” making it hard to understand how they make decisions, which can undermine trust in their results.
- Over-reliance on Automation: Relying too much on AI for decision-making and content creation could result in a lack of human insight and creativity.
- Intellectual Property Risks: The ownership of AI-generated content can be unclear, which may lead to legal challenges over intellectual property rights.
- Regulatory and Ethical Challenges: Generative AI is subject to evolving regulations, and businesses must ensure that AI technologies are used ethically and in compliance with laws.
By understanding and addressing these risks, enterprises can harness the power of generative AI while mitigating potential downsides.

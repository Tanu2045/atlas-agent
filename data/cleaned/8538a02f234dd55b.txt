How to Build First Generative AI Chatbot?
Building First Generative AI chatbot involves multiple steps, from selecting the model to deploying it as an interactive application. Here’s a detailed guide to help create one chatbot development from scratch.
1. Define Chatbot’s Purpose
Before diving into the technical aspects, clarify:
- What will chatbot do?
- General chat?
- Customer support?
- Code generation?
- Personal assistant?
- Who is target audience?
- Casual users? Businesses? Developers?
If you’re just experimenting, a basic conversational chatbot is a great start.
2. Choose a Generative AI Model
There are multiple LLMs (Large Language Models) to choose from:
If you want an easy cloud-based setup, use OpenAI’s GPT-4 API.
If you want a self-hosted model, use LLaMA 2 or Mistral.
3. Set Up Your Development Environment
- Python (or Node.js for JavaScript-based chatbots)
- OpenAI API key (or another provider’s API)
- Flask/FastAPI (for web deployment)
- Frontend (React, HTML, or Telegram/Discord bot)
Install Required Libraries
If using Python, install dependencies:
pip install openai flask
For self-hosted models (like LLaMA), install llama-cpp-python:
pip install llama-cpp-python
4. Build a Basic Chatbot Using OpenAI API
Here’s a simple Python chatbot using GPT-4:
Step 1: Set Up a Flask Server
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai
app = Flask(__name__)
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"
@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():
data = request.json
user_message = data.get("message", "")
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
model="gpt-4",
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_message}]
)
return jsonify({"response": response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]})
if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run(debug=True)
Test the API by sending a POST request with JSON data like:
{ "message": "Hello, chatbot!" }
Step 2: Build Chat UI (HTML + JS)
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>AI Chatbot</title>
<script>
async function sendMessage() {
let userMessage = document.getElementById("userInput").value;
let response = await fetch("/chat", {
method: "POST",
headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
body: JSON.stringify({ message: userMessage })
});
let data = await response.json();
document.getElementById("chat").innerHTML += "<p><b>You:</b> " + userMessage + "</p>";
document.getElementById("chat").innerHTML += "<p><b>Bot:</b> " + data.response + "</p>";
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Chatbot</h1>
<div id="chat"></div>
<input type="text" id="userInput">
<button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>
</body>
</html>
Now, save file as chatbot.py, run this using python on terminal and open localhost:5000 in browser!
Step 3: Modify Flask to Maintain Chat History
By default, GPT doesn’t remember past messages. To maintain context, store previous messages in a list. Modify Flask to Maintain Chat History:
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai
app = Flask(__name__)
openai.api_key = "api-key"
chat_history = []
@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():
data = request.json
user_message = data.get("message", "")
chat_history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_message})
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
model="gpt-4",
messages=chat_history
)
bot_reply = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
chat_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": bot_reply})
return jsonify({"response": bot_reply})
if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run(debug=True)
How to Build Conversational Voice Chatbot?
Adding voice interaction to your generative AI chatbot involves two main components:
- Speech-to-Text (STT) – Convert user speech into text.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) – Convert chatbot responses into speech.
1. Install Required Libraries
Use OpenAI’s Whisper for STT and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) or OpenAI’s TTS for speech output.
pip install openai gtts sounddevice numpy scipy
For offline STT, install Whisper:
pip install whisper
2. Implement Voice Input (Speech-to-Text)
import openai
import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np
import scipy.io.wavfile as wav
openai.api_key = "api-key"
def record_audio(filename="input.wav", duration=5, samplerate=44100):
print("Recording... Speak now!")
audio_data = sd.rec(int(samplerate * duration), samplerate=samplerate, channels=2, dtype=np.int16)
sd.wait()
wav.write(filename, samplerate, audio_data)
print("Recording complete!")
def transcribe_audio(filename="input.wav"):
with open(filename, "rb") as audio_file:
transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe("whisper-1", audio_file)
return transcript["text"]
# Example usage
record_audio()
user_text = transcribe_audio()
print("You said:", user_text)
Now, record your voice and get the transcribed text!
3. Implement Voice Output (Text-to-Speech)
Use Google TTS (gTTS) or OpenAI’s TTS for speech synthesis.
Method 1: Using gTTS (Google)
from gtts import gTTS
import os
def speak(text):
tts = gTTS(text=text, lang="en")
tts.save("response.mp3")
os.system("mpg321 response.mp3") # Use 'afplay' on macOS or 'mpg321' on Linux
# Example usage
speak("Hello! How can I assist you today?")
Method 2: Using OpenAI’s TTS
If prefer OpenAI’s realistic voice synthesis:
def openai_tts(text):
response = openai.Audio.create(
model="tts-1",
input=text,
voice="alloy" # Voices: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer
)
with open("response.mp3", "wb") as audio_file:
audio_file.write(response["audio"])
os.system("mpg321 response.mp3")
openai_tts("Hello! How can I help?")
4. Combine Voice Input & Output in the Chatbot
Now, integrate voice into your chatbot.
import openai
import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np
import scipy.io.wavfile as wav
from gtts import gTTS
import os
openai.api_key = "api-key"
def record_audio(filename="input.wav", duration=5, samplerate=44100):
print("Recording... Speak now!")
audio_data = sd.rec(int(samplerate * duration), samplerate=samplerate, channels=2, dtype=np.int16)
sd.wait()
wav.write(filename, samplerate, audio_data)
print("Recording complete!")
def transcribe_audio(filename="input.wav"):
with open(filename, "rb") as audio_file:
transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe("whisper-1", audio_file)
return transcript["text"]
def chat_with_ai(user_input):
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
model="gpt-4",
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
)
return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
def speak(text):
tts = gTTS(text=text, lang="en")
tts.save("response.mp3")
os.system("mpg321 response.mp3")
while True:
record_audio()
user_text = transcribe_audio()
print("You:", user_text)
if user_text.lower() in ["exit", "quit", "bye"]:
speak("Goodbye!")
break
bot_response = chat_with_ai(user_text)
print("Bot:", bot_response)
speak(bot_response)
This chatbot now listens to your voice, responds with text, and speaks back!
5. Deploy with a Web UI (Flask + JavaScript)
For a web-based voice chatbot, modify your Flask app:
Backend (Flask)
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai
from gtts import gTTS
import os
app = Flask(__name__)
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"
@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():
data = request.json
user_message = data.get("message", "")
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
model="gpt-4",
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_message}]
)
bot_reply = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
# Convert text to speech
tts = gTTS(text=bot_reply, lang="en")
tts.save("static/response.mp3")
return jsonify({"response": bot_reply, "audio": "static/response.mp3"})
if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run(debug=True)
Frontend (HTML + JS)
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>AI Voice Chatbot</title>
<script>
async function sendMessage() {
let userMessage = document.getElementById("userInput").value;
let response = await fetch("/chat", {
method: "POST",
headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
body: JSON.stringify({ message: userMessage })
});
let data = await response.json();
document.getElementById("chat").innerHTML += "<p><b>You:</b> " + userMessage + "</p>";
document.getElementById("chat").innerHTML += "<p><b>Bot:</b> " + data.response + "</p>";
// Play voice response
let audio = new Audio(data.audio);
audio.play();
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<h1>AI Voice Chatbot</h1>
<div id="chat"></div>
<input type="text" id="userInput">
<button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>
</body>
</html>
Now, users can send text and hear the bot’s spoken response!
Advanced Features to Add
- Streaming responses (Use OpenAI’s
stream=True
) - Support multiple languages (Translate responses using
googletrans
) - WhatsApp or Telegram integration (Twilio API)
- Emotion-based voice selection (Choose different TTS voices based on sentiment)
How to Create Image from Text using AI (Text to Image)?
Adding image generation to your generative AI chatbot allows it to create and respond with AI-generated images. This can be done using OpenAI’s DALL·E, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, or MidJourney (via Discord).
1. Install Required Libraries
If you’re using OpenAI’s DALL·E API:
pip install openai flask
For Stable Diffusion (self-hosted):
pip install diffusers transformers torch
2. Generate Images with OpenAI’s DALL·E
If you’re using OpenAI’s DALL·E API, you can generate images based on text prompts.
Generate an Image from Text
import openai
openai.api_key = "api-key"
def generate_image(prompt):
response = openai.Image.create(
model="dall-e-3", # Use "dall-e-2" if needed
prompt=prompt,
size="1024x1024",
n=1
)
return response["data"][0]["url"]
# Example usage
image_url = generate_image("A futuristic city at night with neon lights")
print("Generated Image URL:", image_url)
3. Integrate Image Generation into Your Chatbot
Modify your chatbot to generate images when asked.
Updated Flask Backend
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai
app = Flask(__name__)
openai.api_key = "api-key"
def generate_image(prompt):
response = openai.Image.create(
model="dall-e-3",
prompt=prompt,
size="1024x1024",
n=1
)
return response["data"][0]["url"]
@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():
data = request.json
user_message = data.get("message", "")
if "generate an image" in user_message.lower():
prompt = user_message.replace("generate an image of", "").strip()
image_url = generate_image(prompt)
return jsonify({"response": "Here is your generated image:", "image": image_url})
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
model="gpt-4",
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_message}]
)
return jsonify({"response": response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]})
if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run(debug=True)
This will check if the user requests an image and generate one dynamically.
4. Add Image Display in Frontend (HTML + JavaScript)
Modify your frontend to show the image when generated.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>AI Image Chatbot</title>
<script>
async function sendMessage() {
let userMessage = document.getElementById("userInput").value;
let response = await fetch("/chat", {
method: "POST",
headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
body: JSON.stringify({ message: userMessage })
});
let data = await response.json();
document.getElementById("chat").innerHTML += "<p><b>You:</b> " + userMessage + "</p>";
if (data.image) {
document.getElementById("chat").innerHTML += "<p><b>Bot:</b> " + data.response + "</p>";
document.getElementById("chat").innerHTML += `<img src="${data.image}" width="300">`;
} else {
document.getElementById("chat").innerHTML += "<p><b>Bot:</b> " + data.response + "</p>";
}
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<h1>AI Image Chatbot</h1>
<div id="chat"></div>
<input type="text" id="userInput">
<button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>
</body>
</html>
Now, when users ask for an image, it displays directly in the chat.
5. Use Stable Diffusion for Self-Hosted Image Generation
For local AI image generation, install Stable Diffusion and use diffusers
:
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
# Load model
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5")
pipe.to("cuda") # Use GPU for faster processing
def generate_local_image(prompt):
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image.save("generated_image.png")
return "generated_image.png"
# Example usage
generate_local_image("A dragon flying over a futuristic city")
This runs Stable Diffusion locally, but requires a GPU.

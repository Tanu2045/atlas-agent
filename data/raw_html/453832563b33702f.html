                        Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content such as text,
                        images, audio, or code. It uses machine learning models, especially large language models or
                        generative adversarial networks, to produce original outputs based on patterns in training data.

                        Generative AI works by training on large datasets to learn patterns and relationships. It uses

                        training data. During generation, it predicts the next most likely element such as a word,

                        can launch in 2â3 months, while custom-built solutions with proprietary training may require

                        The main difference between generative AI and machine learning is that generative AI creates new
                        content like text, images, or audio, while machine learning focuses on recognizing patterns and
                        making predictions from data. Generative AI is a subset of machine learning designed
                        specifically for content generation.

                        frameworks, monitor model outputs for bias or misuse, and apply differential privacy techniques
                        to protect user data during training and deployment.

                        defined outcomes within fixed timelines and budgets.

                  Prior to engaging IndianAppDevelopers, TeachKloud was operating a hosted platform for over 300+
                  schools which required modernisation. Impero were very quick to work with us to get a deep
                  understanding of our business and challenges. We are now live with our new system which is awesome.

									<p>In 2025, India’s colleges are clearly in transition — from traditional chalk-and-talk classrooms to dynamic, tech-enabled learning ecosystems that reflect global trends and local needs. With a sharper focus on employability, digital integration, and cross-disciplinary education, colleges are finally moving toward becoming <strong>launchpads for innovation and growth</strong>.</p><p>However, to truly democratize this transformation, the pace of reform must be sustained across all tiers of the education system. For India to reap the full demographic dividend, every student — regardless of city, background, or college ranking — must be equipped with the tools to thrive in the modern world.</p>								</div>
